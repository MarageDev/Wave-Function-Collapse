<h1 align="center"> Wave-Function-Collapse </h2>
<p align="center">
This is an attempt at creating a wave function collapse in python and pygame. I didn't used ressources to create it so it's not optimised or it might not reflect what a wave function collapse algorithm would do. It stills need some works.

> I have few ideas of improvements/upgrades/fix which will be listed in Future

## Requirements 
The program requires PyGame, it can be installed like that :
```console
pip install pygame
```
